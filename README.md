# StarterApp
A small starter app to sample different web frameworks (angular 1, angular 2, react)
* ##App specifications
   * the app must display a list of descriptions of elements in a table 
   * once a description is selected, the details of the element are showned on a side panel
   * the element details side panel must permit the edition of the selected element
   * form validation
	 * the info 2 value is required only if info 1 value is not blank.
         * if the weird element radio button is checked, then the text area must be filled.

* ##Problems encountered/Todos
   * in the angular2 app, I did not find any equivalent to angular-ui-bootstrap to put my form in a modal
   * the radio button do not work as expected in angular 2
